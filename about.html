        <p>
          This is a beginner's project that I made to practice what I have learned in my time on <b>The Odin Project: Foundations course</b>.
          If you're seeing this website with designs or anything else that is still irrelevant in the HTML Foundations subcourse,
          it is because <b>I have used this project as a practice website to test all the things I learned in the following courses after HTML</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
        Don't worry as this website was way simpler in the beginning so don't get demotivated.
          Continue doing the courses provided by The Odin Project, or any other resources you want to improve your skills and get a fulfilling job in the future.
          Goodluck to your journey!
