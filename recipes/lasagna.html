          Lasagna, also known by the Italian plural lasagne, is a type of pasta,
          possibly one of the oldest types, made in very wide, flat sheets. In
          Italian cuisine it is made of stacked layers of pasta alternating with
          fillings such as ragù, béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings
          and spices. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which melts during
          baking.
